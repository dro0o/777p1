![](/media/favicon.ico)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. <br />This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies <br />(webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. <br />All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts <br />so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, <br />and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t <br />be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
